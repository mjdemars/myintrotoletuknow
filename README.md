# myintrotoletuknow

## In my Experimental Digital Art class, we were tasked with creating a digital introduction project, #myintrotoletuknow inspired by OutKast.
## To give the class a intro into who I am, I decided to create a personal album, utilizing my graphic design and simple animation skills.
## This album features songs that have inspired through my years as a creative in chronological order.
## The drawings on the album cover art also pay homage to each of these songs as my selfie is surrounded by figures from each piece of digital content that has inspire me.
## On this web page, I linked a Spotify playlist that you can listen to in order to get a little insight into who I am.
